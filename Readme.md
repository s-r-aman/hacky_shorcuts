# Shortcuts Hacks

This repository majorly contains the scripts that is use to boost my workflow.

**This project is heavily inspired by _Taran Van Hemert_.**

These are the Auto Hot Key scripts that I use.

1. [Abbreviations](/abbreviations.ahk) - All the abbreviations that is use for my email addresses, phrases that I use and signatures.
2. [Media](/media.ahk) - All the media shortcuts.
3. [Utilities](/utilities.ahk) - All the tools and apps opening shortcuts. Cool thing is, Alt + 2 opens chrome and on pressing continuously, chrome cycles between the tabs. And Alt + ` opens the windows explorer and on pressing continuously, cycles between all the file explorer.
